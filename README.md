# Ponglish
My first polished game, which is pong!

## Features
- The assets are built into the executable thus there is no dependence on the current working directory
- Smooth movement
- RGB Background :)
- Sound effects generated with jsfxr
- Count down on game continue
- Ball speeds up over time

## Building
 - Requires you to have raylib installed system wide
```bash
    ./build.sh && ./main
```
